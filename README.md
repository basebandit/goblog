### GOBLOG
A good friend and my mentor [John Arundel](https://bitfieldconsulting.com) posed this challenge to me. The goal was to create a blog server. He gave me the freedom to decide what features I would want it to have. So I decided to start small and go with basic features CRUD.   
- [x] C User can create a new blog entry.
- [ ] R User can read an existing blog entry.
- [ ] U User can update an existing blog entry.
- [ ] D User can delete a blog entry.

## How To Run
To run this project, all you need is to run the make commands defined in the Makefile. 
Therefore you need to run the following commands in succession

```bash
 make dev-up
 make tests
 ```

To shutdown the containers run the following command.

```bash
make dev-down
```
